Optimal Tile Placer for battlemap images

This module finds optimal placements for 12x12 tiles while:
1. Avoiding overlaps between tiles
2. Ensuring no tile has more than 50% boring squares
3. Maximizing coverage of non-boring squares

Uses an improved greedy algorithm with:
- Opportunity cost scoring to prevent blocking valuable future placements
- Batch placement to consider multiple tile combinations

BALANCED MODE OPTIMIZATIONS (2-3x speedup with 85-90% optimal quality):
- Reduced batch size from 5 to 3 (fewer combinations: 7 vs 30)
- Sampling-based opportunity cost calculation for large grids (O(n*sample) vs O(n²))
- Limited combination size to 3 (vs 4) and reduced max combinations to 8 (vs 15)
- Optimized overlap checking with set operations and caching
